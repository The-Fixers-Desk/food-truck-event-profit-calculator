# Saved Events — Acceptance Checklist

## Document control

- **Product:** Food Truck Event Profit Calculator
- **Owner:** The Fixer’s Desk
- **Artifact:** Acceptance checklist / definition of done
- **Reference:** Approved Saved Events mockup and corresponding engineering specification
- **Result rule:** Every item must pass before the screen is accepted.

## How to use this checklist

Evaluate each line as an objective **PASS** or **FAIL** against the approved reference mockup, engineering specification, and functioning build. A visual approximation is not sufficient. Any failure requires correction and re-review.

## Global visual and implementation checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The implemented screen matches the approved reference mockup in structure, visual hierarchy, density, and overall composition.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No navy or blue cast appears in the canvas, sidebar, cards, fields, gradients, shadows, or overlays.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The charcoal token family is used: canvas `#111315`, sidebar `#121416`, surface `#181B1D`, elevated surface `#1E2123`, inset surface `#151719`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Copper `#C47A3A` is the primary accent; green, warning, and danger colors are reserved for their semantic states.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text hierarchy, type weights, line heights, and tabular numerals match the specification.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Standard radii, borders, dividers, spacing tokens, and control heights are consistent with the shared design system.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Every interactive control has visible default, hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, and loading states where applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Keyboard focus uses a clearly visible copper focus ring and never relies on color alone.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Motion is 150–200 ms, uses ease-out, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Existing calculations, routes, persistence, imports/exports, and workflows remain functional unless the specification explicitly changes them.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Reusable shell, button, card, field, badge, status, and responsive-layout components are used rather than duplicated one-off markup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No new content, actions, or states have been invented beyond the approved mockup and specification.

## Shared shell checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** At desktop widths, the sidebar is 280 px wide and the top bar is 64 px high.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Main content is centered and does not exceed 1280 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop content padding is 32 px, compact desktop/tablet padding is 24 px, and mobile padding is 16 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Sidebar branding remains at the top and the user menu remains pinned to the bottom.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Breadcrumbs appear on the left of the top bar; search, notifications, and help appear on the right.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Below 1024 px, the persistent sidebar is replaced by the approved top app bar and drawer pattern.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page never introduces unintended horizontal scrolling.

## Accessibility and responsive checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text, icons, state borders, and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All interactive controls are keyboard reachable in visual order.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Icon-only controls have accessible names.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Dynamic status, save, validation, and calculation changes are announced through an appropriate polite live region.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Validation messages are programmatically associated with fields and announced on submission.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Recommendation and status states include text labels in addition to color and iconography.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop (`>=1280 px`), tablet (`768–1279 px`), and mobile (`<768 px`) layouts match the specified transformations.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Full-width primary actions and stacked controls are used on mobile where specified.


## Saved Events-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** `Saved events` is the active sidebar item.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page shows the Event Library eyebrow, `Your saved events` title, approved description, filters, sort control, and New analysis action.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Status filters include All events, Worth it, Borderline, and Not worth it with accurate counts.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Applying a status filter updates the list and result count without losing sort order.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Summary metrics for saved events, total scenarios, and recently updated items are accurate.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop table columns include Event name, Date, Location, Scenarios, Last updated, Recommendation, and Actions.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Each event row shows the correct scenario count and latest recommendation state.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** `Open` returns the user to the correct event and most recent scenario context.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** `Compare` opens Scenario Comparison for that event and is disabled or adapted when comparison is not possible.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Row chevrons and row-level clicks do not create conflicting or duplicate navigation behavior.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Sorting by Last updated and any other specified sortable column produces correct stable ordering.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Pagination displays the correct range, page count, and disabled boundary controls.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Search and filters can be combined and the result set is correct.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The empty-state screen offers a clear path to start the first analysis.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Mobile transforms each table row into an accessible labeled card without losing metadata or actions.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop table headers remain semantic and mobile cards preserve programmatic field labels.

## Final acceptance

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No unresolved visual deviations remain when the implementation is reviewed side by side with the approved mockup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No functional regression exists in any workflow touched by this screen.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All automated tests, keyboard checks, responsive checks, and manual acceptance checks pass.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The screen feels visually and behaviorally cohesive with the other nine product screens.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Product owner approval has been recorded.
