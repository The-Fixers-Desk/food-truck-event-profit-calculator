# Scenario Comparison — Acceptance Checklist

## Document control

- **Product:** Food Truck Event Profit Calculator
- **Owner:** The Fixer’s Desk
- **Artifact:** Acceptance checklist / definition of done
- **Reference:** Approved Scenario Comparison mockup and corresponding engineering specification
- **Result rule:** Every item must pass before the screen is accepted.

## How to use this checklist

Evaluate each line as an objective **PASS** or **FAIL** against the approved reference mockup, engineering specification, and functioning build. A visual approximation is not sufficient. Any failure requires correction and re-review.

## Global visual and implementation checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The implemented screen matches the approved reference mockup in structure, visual hierarchy, density, and overall composition.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No navy or blue cast appears in the canvas, sidebar, cards, fields, gradients, shadows, or overlays.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The charcoal token family is used: canvas `#111315`, sidebar `#121416`, surface `#181B1D`, elevated surface `#1E2123`, inset surface `#151719`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Copper `#C47A3A` is the primary accent; green, warning, and danger colors are reserved for their semantic states.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text hierarchy, type weights, line heights, and tabular numerals match the specification.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Standard radii, borders, dividers, spacing tokens, and control heights are consistent with the shared design system.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Every interactive control has visible default, hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, and loading states where applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Keyboard focus uses a clearly visible copper focus ring and never relies on color alone.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Motion is 150–200 ms, uses ease-out, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Existing calculations, routes, persistence, imports/exports, and workflows remain functional unless the specification explicitly changes them.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Reusable shell, button, card, field, badge, status, and responsive-layout components are used rather than duplicated one-off markup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No new content, actions, or states have been invented beyond the approved mockup and specification.

## Shared shell checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** At desktop widths, the sidebar is 280 px wide and the top bar is 64 px high.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Main content is centered and does not exceed 1280 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop content padding is 32 px, compact desktop/tablet padding is 24 px, and mobile padding is 16 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Sidebar branding remains at the top and the user menu remains pinned to the bottom.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Breadcrumbs appear on the left of the top bar; search, notifications, and help appear on the right.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Below 1024 px, the persistent sidebar is replaced by the approved top app bar and drawer pattern.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page never introduces unintended horizontal scrolling.

## Accessibility and responsive checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text, icons, state borders, and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All interactive controls are keyboard reachable in visual order.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Icon-only controls have accessible names.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Dynamic status, save, validation, and calculation changes are announced through an appropriate polite live region.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Validation messages are programmatically associated with fields and announced on submission.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Recommendation and status states include text labels in addition to color and iconography.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop (`>=1280 px`), tablet (`768–1279 px`), and mobile (`<768 px`) layouts match the specified transformations.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Full-width primary actions and stacked controls are used on mobile where specified.


## Scenario Comparison-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The breadcrumb identifies Saved events, the current event, and Compare scenarios.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The comparison is limited to scenarios belonging to the selected event.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The screen enforces the specified minimum and maximum number of scenarios for comparison.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The event selector, Add scenario, and Keep selected scenario controls work as specified.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Each scenario card shows name, recommendation badge, revenue, costs, profit, margin, and break-even buyers.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Metrics displayed in comparison exactly match the corresponding Event Analysis Workspace values.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The strongest scenario is visually emphasized without relying on color alone.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The assumptions table includes average ticket, expected buyers, service hours, crew size, travel/setup, food-cost percentage, and event conditions.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Values align correctly under each scenario and row labels remain visible while scanning.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Impact indicators accurately describe whether higher, lower, or contextual values are preferable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Bar lengths or visual indicators are normalized consistently and do not misrepresent numeric differences.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The recommendation strip identifies the correct best scenario and explains the decisive metrics.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Best profit, best margin, and lowest break-even values are correct.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Keeping a selected scenario returns to analysis with that scenario selected and does not delete alternatives.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Adding/removing comparison scenarios updates the table and recommendation deterministically.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Tablet and mobile preserve comparable labels and values; mobile never requires users to infer which scenario a value belongs to.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Any horizontal comparison region is explicitly labeled, keyboard accessible, and has an accessible stacked alternative where specified.

## Final acceptance

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No unresolved visual deviations remain when the implementation is reviewed side by side with the approved mockup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No functional regression exists in any workflow touched by this screen.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All automated tests, keyboard checks, responsive checks, and manual acceptance checks pass.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The screen feels visually and behaviorally cohesive with the other nine product screens.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Product owner approval has been recorded.
