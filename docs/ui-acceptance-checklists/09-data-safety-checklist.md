# Data Safety — Acceptance Checklist

## Document control

- **Product:** Food Truck Event Profit Calculator
- **Owner:** The Fixer’s Desk
- **Artifact:** Acceptance checklist / definition of done
- **Reference:** Approved Data Safety mockup and corresponding engineering specification
- **Result rule:** Every item must pass before the screen is accepted.

## How to use this checklist

Evaluate each line as an objective **PASS** or **FAIL** against the approved reference mockup, engineering specification, and functioning build. A visual approximation is not sufficient. Any failure requires correction and re-review.

## Global visual and implementation checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The implemented screen matches the approved reference mockup in structure, visual hierarchy, density, and overall composition.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No navy or blue cast appears in the canvas, sidebar, cards, fields, gradients, shadows, or overlays.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The charcoal token family is used: canvas `#111315`, sidebar `#121416`, surface `#181B1D`, elevated surface `#1E2123`, inset surface `#151719`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Copper `#C47A3A` is the primary accent; green, warning, and danger colors are reserved for their semantic states.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text hierarchy, type weights, line heights, and tabular numerals match the specification.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Standard radii, borders, dividers, spacing tokens, and control heights are consistent with the shared design system.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Every interactive control has visible default, hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, and loading states where applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Keyboard focus uses a clearly visible copper focus ring and never relies on color alone.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Motion is 150–200 ms, uses ease-out, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Existing calculations, routes, persistence, imports/exports, and workflows remain functional unless the specification explicitly changes them.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Reusable shell, button, card, field, badge, status, and responsive-layout components are used rather than duplicated one-off markup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No new content, actions, or states have been invented beyond the approved mockup and specification.

## Shared shell checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** At desktop widths, the sidebar is 280 px wide and the top bar is 64 px high.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Main content is centered and does not exceed 1280 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop content padding is 32 px, compact desktop/tablet padding is 24 px, and mobile padding is 16 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Sidebar branding remains at the top and the user menu remains pinned to the bottom.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Breadcrumbs appear on the left of the top bar; search, notifications, and help appear on the right.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Below 1024 px, the persistent sidebar is replaced by the approved top app bar and drawer pattern.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page never introduces unintended horizontal scrolling.

## Accessibility and responsive checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text, icons, state borders, and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All interactive controls are keyboard reachable in visual order.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Icon-only controls have accessible names.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Dynamic status, save, validation, and calculation changes are announced through an appropriate polite live region.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Validation messages are programmatically associated with fields and announced on submission.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Recommendation and status states include text labels in addition to color and iconography.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop (`>=1280 px`), tablet (`768–1279 px`), and mobile (`<768 px`) layouts match the specified transformations.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Full-width primary actions and stacked controls are used on mobile where specified.


## Data Safety-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** `Data safety` is the active sidebar item.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page clearly states that data is stored locally, works offline, requires no account, and is not cloud-synced.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Local Data Summary counts for saved events, scenarios, and business defaults are accurate.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Last export date and status reflect the latest successful export only.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Auto-save messaging is accurate and does not imply cloud backup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Privacy Model rows display Stored locally, No cloud sync, No account required, and Works offline.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Export creates a complete valid backup containing all specified events, scenarios, defaults, and version metadata.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Import validates file type, schema version, required fields, and data integrity before changing local data.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Invalid imports leave existing data untouched and show a clear actionable error.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Import conflict behavior matches the specification and never silently overwrites data.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Download sample format returns the correct documented schema example.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Destructive actions are isolated in the Danger Zone and cannot be triggered accidentally.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Delete events, Reset defaults, and Clear everything each show a confirmation that names the exact scope.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Confirmed destructive actions affect only the stated data and preserve unrelated data where applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Canceling any destructive confirmation makes no changes.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The UI recommends exporting before destructive actions.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Success and failure results for export, import, and deletion are announced accessibly.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Mobile preserves all management actions and does not make destructive actions easier to trigger than on desktop.

## Final acceptance

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No unresolved visual deviations remain when the implementation is reviewed side by side with the approved mockup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No functional regression exists in any workflow touched by this screen.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All automated tests, keyboard checks, responsive checks, and manual acceptance checks pass.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The screen feels visually and behaviorally cohesive with the other nine product screens.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Product owner approval has been recorded.
