# System Pages — Acceptance Checklist

## Document control

- **Product:** Food Truck Event Profit Calculator
- **Owner:** The Fixer’s Desk
- **Artifact:** Acceptance checklist / definition of done
- **Reference:** Approved System Pages mockup and corresponding engineering specification
- **Result rule:** Every item must pass before the screen is accepted.

## How to use this checklist

Evaluate each line as an objective **PASS** or **FAIL** against the approved reference mockup, engineering specification, and functioning build. A visual approximation is not sufficient. Any failure requires correction and re-review.

## Global visual and implementation checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The implemented screen matches the approved reference mockup in structure, visual hierarchy, density, and overall composition.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No navy or blue cast appears in the canvas, sidebar, cards, fields, gradients, shadows, or overlays.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The charcoal token family is used: canvas `#111315`, sidebar `#121416`, surface `#181B1D`, elevated surface `#1E2123`, inset surface `#151719`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Copper `#C47A3A` is the primary accent; green, warning, and danger colors are reserved for their semantic states.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text hierarchy, type weights, line heights, and tabular numerals match the specification.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Standard radii, borders, dividers, spacing tokens, and control heights are consistent with the shared design system.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Every interactive control has visible default, hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, and loading states where applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Keyboard focus uses a clearly visible copper focus ring and never relies on color alone.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Motion is 150–200 ms, uses ease-out, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Existing calculations, routes, persistence, imports/exports, and workflows remain functional unless the specification explicitly changes them.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Reusable shell, button, card, field, badge, status, and responsive-layout components are used rather than duplicated one-off markup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No new content, actions, or states have been invented beyond the approved mockup and specification.

## Shared shell checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** At desktop widths, the sidebar is 280 px wide and the top bar is 64 px high.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Main content is centered and does not exceed 1280 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop content padding is 32 px, compact desktop/tablet padding is 24 px, and mobile padding is 16 px.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Sidebar branding remains at the top and the user menu remains pinned to the bottom.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Breadcrumbs appear on the left of the top bar; search, notifications, and help appear on the right.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Below 1024 px, the persistent sidebar is replaced by the approved top app bar and drawer pattern.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The page never introduces unintended horizontal scrolling.

## Accessibility and responsive checks

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Text, icons, state borders, and focus indicators meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All interactive controls are keyboard reachable in visual order.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Icon-only controls have accessible names.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Dynamic status, save, validation, and calculation changes are announced through an appropriate polite live region.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Validation messages are programmatically associated with fields and announced on submission.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Recommendation and status states include text labels in addition to color and iconography.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Desktop (`>=1280 px`), tablet (`768–1279 px`), and mobile (`<768 px`) layouts match the specified transformations.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Full-width primary actions and stacked controls are used on mobile where specified.


## System Pages-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All reusable states use the shared state-page component and approved visual hierarchy.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Every state includes a clear icon, concise title, plain-language explanation, and at least one recovery or next-step action when applicable.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The empty state reads `No saved events yet` and offers `Start first analysis` plus the approved secondary learning action.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The empty-state CTA routes to the new-analysis flow.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The loading state displays `Calculating your estimate...` with the approved progress or skeleton treatment.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Loading indicators are announced accessibly without repeatedly interrupting screen-reader users.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The error state reads `We couldn't load this event`, offers Retry, and offers the approved route back to saved events.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Retry repeats the failed operation and accurately updates the state on success or failure.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The not-found/removed state clearly says the event no longer exists and provides the approved return path.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The offline state says the user is offline while accurately indicating that local data remains available.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Offline behavior does not block locally available saved events or calculations that do not require a network.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** System-state copy avoids technical jargon, blame, raw exception messages, and false promises.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** State-specific actions preserve keyboard focus and route history appropriately.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The reusable implementation API accepts the specified state, title, message, icon, primary action, secondary action, and status options.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Tablet and mobile transform the state gallery or state page without truncating messages or hiding recovery actions.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Each state is testable independently through deterministic fixtures or routes.

## Final acceptance

- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No unresolved visual deviations remain when the implementation is reviewed side by side with the approved mockup.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** No functional regression exists in any workflow touched by this screen.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** All automated tests, keyboard checks, responsive checks, and manual acceptance checks pass.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** The screen feels visually and behaviorally cohesive with the other nine product screens.
- [ ] **PASS / FAIL:** Product owner approval has been recorded.
