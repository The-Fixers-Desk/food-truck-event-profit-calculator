# Business Defaults Wizard — Engineering Specification

## Document control

- **Product:** Food Truck Event Profit Calculator
- **Owner:** The Fixer’s Desk
- **Reference mockup:** `Business Defaults Wizard charcoal mockup`
- **Status:** Implementation blueprint
- **Source of truth order:** approved mockup → this specification → existing business logic

## Purpose

Capture reusable business assumptions once so every future event analysis begins with realistic values.

**Dominant task:** Complete and save reusable business defaults.

The approved mockup defines visual intent. This document removes implementation ambiguity for layout, spacing, typography, colors, component behavior, responsive behavior, and interaction rules.

### Typography

Use Inter, system-ui, or the existing product sans-serif. Use tabular numerals for currency, counts, percentages, dates, and calculations.

| Style | Desktop | Weight | Line height |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Display / page title | 40px | 700 | 1.12 |
| Section title | 24px | 650 | 1.2 |
| Card title | 18px | 650 | 1.3 |
| Body | 15px | 400 | 1.55 |
| Label | 13px | 600 | 1.35 |
| Metadata | 12px | 400 | 1.4 |
| Eyebrow | 12px uppercase | 700 | 1.2 |

### Global interaction rules

- Every interactive element must have default, hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, and loading states.
- Focus-visible uses `shadow.focus`; never rely on color alone.
- Primary actions use copper fill and white text. Secondary actions use transparent or `surface` fill with a 1 px border.
- Icons are 20 px by default, 16 px in compact controls, and 24–32 px in feature or state illustrations.
- Default control height is 40 px; prominent primary buttons may be 44 px.
- Motion duration is 150–200 ms with ease-out. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- All destructive actions require explicit confirmation and describe the scope of deletion.



## Shell requirements

- Desktop sidebar width: **280 px**.
- Desktop top bar height: **64 px**.
- Main content maximum width: **1280 px**, centered within available shell space.
- Desktop horizontal content padding: **32 px**; compact desktop/tablet: **24 px**; mobile: **16 px**.
- Standard vertical section spacing: **32 px**.
- Sidebar branding remains at the top and user menu remains pinned to the bottom.
- Top bar places breadcrumbs on the left and search, notifications, and help on the right.
- At widths below 1024 px, replace the persistent sidebar with a top app bar and drawer.


## Wizard structure

Five internal sections:

1. Revenue assumptions
2. Food cost method
3. Profit rule
4. Operating assumptions
5. Review

- Steps 1–5 persist independently and may be revisited before completion.
- Completed steps show a success check. Active step uses copper outline and indicator. Upcoming steps remain neutral.
- First-use progress above the wizard shows Setup completed, Defaults active, Dashboard upcoming.

## Desktop layout

- Left step-navigation column: 312 px.
- Right form panel: flexible, minimum 560 px.
- Gap: 20 px.
- Sticky action footer remains visible at the bottom of the form panel when content scrolls.

## Field and conditional rules

- Revenue method and food-cost method use mutually exclusive card radios.
- Profit rule asks: `How do you decide whether an event is worth accepting?`
- Options: `Minimum profit amount` and `Minimum profit margin`.
- Show only the input associated with the selected option.
- Switching options clears the now-hidden value only when the user confirms the switch or submits; never save both values.
- Preserve invalid submitted values and the selected option while displaying validation.
- Currency fields accept non-negative decimal values with two-decimal formatting.
- Percentage fields accept 0–100 inclusive and display a percent suffix.

## Current-default snapshot

- Display Average ticket, Food cost, Crew size, and Travel rate.
- Snapshot updates after valid field changes and reflects persisted values, not uncommitted invalid text.
- The note `These are starting defaults — every event can still be adjusted individually.` is always visible.

## Save behavior

- Auto-save valid step progress locally after debounce or field blur.
- Status text: `Progress saved automatically`.
- `Save and finish later` saves valid entered fields, preserves the active step, and returns to Dashboard.
- `Continue` validates the current step before advancing.
- `Back` never discards valid changes.

## Review and completion

- Review groups values by section and provides Edit links that return to the corresponding step.
- Completion writes a versioned defaults record, marks onboarding defaults complete, and routes to Dashboard.

## Responsive behavior

- Tablet: step list narrows or becomes an accordion above the form.
- Mobile: show compact `Step n of 5`, horizontal progress, form only, and a sticky bottom Continue button. Step navigation opens in a modal sheet or accordion.



## Responsive breakpoints

- **Desktop:** `>= 1280 px` — full shell, maximum content width, multi-column layout.
- **Compact desktop / tablet:** `768–1279 px` — drawer or narrow rail as space requires; reduce columns and card density.
- **Mobile:** `< 768 px` — single-column content, top app bar, full-width primary actions, stacked controls.
- Do not horizontally scroll the page. Only comparison tables or data grids may use an explicitly labeled horizontal scroll region when no accessible stacked alternative is viable.



## Accessibility requirements

- Meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast for text, icons, borders that convey state, and focus indicators.
- All controls are keyboard reachable in visual order.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only controls and announce dynamic calculation/status changes with a polite live region.
- Tables must retain semantic headers on desktop; mobile transformations must preserve row labels programmatically.
- Recommendation states must include text labels in addition to color and iconography.
- Validation messages must be associated with their fields using `aria-describedby` and announced on submit.


## Implementation constraints

- Preserve all existing routes, calculations, persistence, imports/exports, and workflows unless this specification explicitly changes presentation behavior.
- Build reusable shell, button, card, field, badge, status, data-row, and responsive-layout components.
- Do not introduce new dependencies solely to reproduce simple visual effects.
- The implementation must not invent content, actions, or states that are absent from the approved mockup or this specification.
